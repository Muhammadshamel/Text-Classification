# Text-Classification

### Problem:
You can think of the job industry as the category or general field. So "industry" refers to a broad category under which a number of job titles can fall. 
For example, 'Software Engineer', 'Full Stack developer', 'Java developer' are all job titles under industry 'IT' and so on.

### Dataset:
Dataset consists of two columns 'Job Titles' and 'Industry' 

### Solution:
This code classifies any job title into the 4 classes in the 'Industry' column.
